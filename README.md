# FLOAT - Epistemic Nexus

- https://floating-epistemic-nexus.lovable.app/

FLOAT is a conceptual framework presented as an interactive digital experience. It explores epistemology, identity, and heresy through visual language and symbolic representation.

## Concepts

FLOAT articulates seven core concepts represented through glyphs and visual metaphors:

1. **Heresy as Interface** - Exploring unauthorized protocols as interfaces with forbidden truths
2. **Identity as Wayfinding** - Understanding the self as a compass forged in wandering
3. **Knowledge as Recursive Ritual** - Examining how knowledge must be callable, structurally and reverently
4. **Horror as Unstable Epistemology** - Considering how horror breaks models of knowing
5. **Liberation Through Breakdown** - Seeing how control systems collapse under recursive self-awareness
6. **Memory as a Live System** - Understanding memory as ritual architecture, responsive and evolving
7. **FLOAT Itself** - A way of surviving the archive, a rebellion staged in notation
